## Pre-Penetration Test Checklist

- [ ] Know the Rules of Engagement
- [ ] Know the time the customer want the active portions (scanning, enumeration, exploitation, etc...) of the penetration test to be conducted
- [ ] How many total IP addresses are being tested (if applicable) ?
- [ ] Are there any devices in place that may impact the results of a penetration test such as a firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system, web application firewall, or load balancer?

    - [ ] Will enumeration of rogue devices be necessary?
    - [ ] Will the team be assessing wireless attacks against clients?
    - [ ] Approximately how many clients will be using the wireless network?

# Pentest Toolkit


## Pre-Penetration Test Checklist

- [ ] Know the Rules of Engagement
- [ ] Know the time the customer want the active portions (scanning, enumeration, exploitation, etc...) of the penetration test to be conducted


## Testing Methodology (and Things to Remember)

### Network Penetration Test 


#### Things to Know
- [ ] How many total IP addresses are being tested ?
    - [ ] How many internal IP addresses, if applicable?
    - [ ] How many external IP addresses, if applicable?
- [ ] Are there any devices in place that may impact the results of a penetration test such as a firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system, web application firewall, or load balancer?
- [ ] In the case that a system is penetrated, how should the testing team proceed?
    - [ ] Perform a local vulnerability assessment on the compromised machine?
    - [ ] Attempt to gain the highest privileges (root on Unix machines, SYSTEM or Administrator on Windows machines) on the compromised machine?
    - [ ] Perform no, minimal, dictionary, or exhaustive password attacks against local password hashes obtained (for example, /etc/shadow on Unix machines)?


### Wifi Penetration Test  

#### Things to Know
- [ ] How many wireless networks are in place?
- [ ] Is a guest wireless network used? If so:
    - [ ] Does the guest network require authentication?
    - [ ] What type of encryption is used on the wireless networks?
    - [ ] What is the square footage of coverage?
    - [ ] Will enumeration of rogue devices be necessary?
    - [ ] Will the team be assessing wireless attacks against clients?
    - [ ] Approximately how many clients will be using the wireless network?

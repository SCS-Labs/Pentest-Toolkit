# OSINT

> Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in the simplest of terms is locating, and analyzing publically (open) available sources of information. The key component here is that this intelligence gathering process has a goal of producing current and relevant information that is valuable to either an attacker or competitor. For the most part, OSINT is more than simply performing web searches using various sources.

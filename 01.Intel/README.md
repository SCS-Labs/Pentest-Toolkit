> Intelligence Gathering is the phase where data or "intelligence" is gathered to assist in guiding the assessment actions. At the broadest level this intelligence gathering includes information about employees, facilities, products and plans. Within a larger picture this intelligence will include potentially secret or private "intelligence" of a competitor, or information that is otherwise relevant to the target.
